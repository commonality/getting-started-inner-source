## 1. The InnerSource working model defined

**The InnerSource working model** applies the open-source product delivery model to private, internal IT teams. Like open-source, InnerSource is a **_decentralized product delivery model_** based on _open_ and **_transparent collaboration_**. InnerSource relies on **_peer production_** to deliver features and fixes to consumers. InnerSource also depends on lightweight **_documentation_** in order to _market to consumers_ and _encourage community contributions_.

### 1.1. InnerSource principles

_InnerSource is a:_

 - Decentralized product delivery model
 - Peer production network of self-organizing communities of interest and practice
 - Community-driven enterprise aimed at converting _users_ into _contributors_.

_InnerSource depends on:_

 - Documentation to share knowledge efficiently
 - Community contributions for product development and delivery
 - Continuous testing and integration to support voluntary changes
 - Transparent and measurable objectives

### 1.2. The five steps of InnerSource Product Delivery

> InnerSource product delivery is a simple, five-step process.

## 2. InnerSource and current business challenges

### 2.1. IT rationalization and modernization

> IT Rationalization provides a framework for managing and monitoring our investment in existing (and proposed) software applications predictably and efficiently, to ensure that IT assets are effective in their role of realizing business strategy.

#### 2.1.1. Challenges

IT Rationalization and Moderation manages applications from development and acquisition to retirement and removal based on strategic alignment with predictable risk and financial reduction.

#### 2.1.2. InnerSource solutions

InnerSource product delivery is self-directed The InnerSource working model _requires_ openness and transparency

#### 2.1.3. Measuring success

1. Software product retirement trends

    _How:_

    > Track internal and vendor software product retirments over time, starting with
    >
    > * Enterprise Decision Records with the status <kbd>EDR: Retire</kbd>
    > * Time to deprecate those products.
    > * Time to take those products "offline."

1. TechStack formation and adoption

    _How:_

    > * Full technology stacks&mdash;with managed, security-approved dependencies&mdash;are readily available to engineers.
    > * The number of software products deployed based on approved TechStacks.

### 2.2. Agile delivery team silos and geographically dispersed teams

> Agile software development approaches product development iteratively and incrementally, resulting in products that evolve over time. Agile stresses the importance of co-located, cross-functional teams in order to communicate and collaborate quickly.

#### 2.2.1. Challenges

Agile, when properly executed, can delivery value to consumers quickly and inexpensively.

---

**_Agile does not, however, address the problem of business silos._**

---

![Siloed product developement][siloed-agile-teams-img]

---

Moreover, optimal agile product delivery requires co-located team members in order to communicate and delivery quickly.

---

**_Product delivery teams are rarely co-located, which can result in "geographic silos."_**

---

#### 2.2.2. InnerSource solutions

The InnerSource working model applies to all product delivery strategies, including Agile _and_ waterfall. How teams collaborate is up to each team. InnerSource complements Agile teams:

![InnerSource complements Agile product delivery][inner-source-and-agile-img]

The InnerSource working model is based on the open-source model, in which geographically dispersed teams are the _norm_, not the exception.

![Distributed teams][icon-distributed-teams-img]

To communicate effectively and asynchronously, InnerSource delivery teams rely on:

 - Simple documentation like README files to help _users_ install and use their product.
 - CONTRIBUTING documents to help users become _contributors_ to product development and delivery.
 - Test and quality assurance automation.
 - Tools like GitHub and GitLab for version control with enhanced collaboration features.

<blockquote>
  <h4>Combining Agile methodologies with structured, asynchronous workflows leads
      to higher quality products and more efficient delivery.</h4>
</blockquote>

---

#### 2.2.3. Measuring success

1. Issues worked from submissions outside a product's organization

    _How:_

    > Track issues submitted by contributors outside of the organization that supports a product.
    > Track whether those same issues resulted in changes to the product.
    >
    > ```python
    > percentageOutsideEngagement = ( issuesWorked / issuesSubmitted ) * 100
    > ```

1. Outside contributions merged and released

    _How:_

    > Track pull requests (PRs) from contributors outside of the organization that supports a product.
    > Track whether those same PRs were merged into the product and released.
    >
    > ```python
    > percentageOutsideContributions = ( pullRequestsSubmitted / pullRequestsMerged ) * 100
    > ```

### 2.4. Tribal knowledge

#### 2.4.1. Challenges

---

**_Siloed teams neither record nor share knowledge beyond their immediate teams._**

---

| ![Restricted access to documentation][icon-docs-acl-img] | ![No documentation exists][icon-docs-none-img] | ![Documentation isn't available via search engines][icon-docs-hidden-img] |
|:--------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     Access to documentation is either restricted...      |          ...or simply doesn't exist.           |           This makes searching for knowledge nearly impossible.           |

#### 2.4.2. InnerSource solutions

The success of InnerSource product delivery depends on sharing information openly and transparently.

#### 2.4.3. Measuring success

1. Track the number of software repositories with standardized READMEs.

    _How:_

    > ```python
    > percentageOfReposWithReadmes = ( numberOfReposWithReadmes / totalNumberOfRepos ) * 100
    > ```

1. Score READMEs for quality.

    _How:_

    > * Adopt the CoCoPods [**ReadmeScore** calculation](https://github.com/clayallsopp/readme-score/#readme)
    > * Provide badges for display, e.g.,
    >
    >     ![readme-quality-score](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20quality-90-green.svg?style=flat-square)

## 3. Our mission

<blockquote><h3>We <em>quickly</em> deliver <em>innovative</em>, <em>reusable</em> software that is <em>secure</em> and <em>mature</em> enough to <em>accept community contributions</em>.</h3></blockquote>

Let's break the mission statement down and explain why it's significant.

### 3.1. InnerSource builds engineering discipline

InnerSource (and Open Source) products are developed, maintained, and delivered based on voluntary contributions from virtual strangers.

Consequently, InnerSource product delivery teams rely on _automated CI services_ like:

* Builds
* Code quality assessments and relentless refactoring
* Dependency drift management
* PCI data violations
* Published (and automated) code style guidelines
* Unit testing and code coverage on _target platforms_
* Vulnerability detection

### 3.2. InnerSource requires teams to "think like startups"

Moreover, InnerSource teams "sell" their products in order to compel their peers to adopt their software.
This requires teams to:

* Architect and design products that are modular enough for parallal work
* Comply with open source licenses
* Distribute (or divest) software
* Limit product complexity
* Manage intellectual property issues
* Manage risk
* Manage security updates
* Plan for support

<h3><em>Successful InnerSource and open-source teams are mature business and engineering teams.</em></h3>
