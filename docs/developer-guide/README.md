# Developer Guide

This guide is intended for those who wish to:

* Contribute code to {product-name}
* Create their own rules for {product-name}

In order to work with {product-name} as a developer, it's recommended that:

* You know JavaScript, since {product-name} is written in JavaScript.
* You have some familiarity with Node.js, since {product-name} runs on it.
* You're comfortable with command-line programs.
* You understand unit tests and why they're important.

If that sounds like you, then continue reading to get started.

## 1: Get the [Source Code](source-code.md)

Before you can get started, you'll need to get a copy of the {product-name} source code. This section explains how to do that and a little about the source code structure.

## 2: Set up a [Development Environment](development-environment.md)

Developing for {product-name} is a bit different than running it on the command line. This section shows you how to set up a development environment and get you ready to write code.

## 3: Run the [Unit Tests](unit-tests.md)

There are a lot of unit tests included with {product-name} to make sure that we're keeping on top of code quality. This section explains how to run the unit tests.

## 4: [Working with Rules](working-with-rules.md)

You're finally ready to start working with rules. You may want to fix an existing rule or create a new one. This section explains how to do all of that.

## 5: [Working with Plugins](working-with-plugins.md)

You've developed library-specific rules for {product-name} and you want to share it with the community. You can publish an {product-name} plugin on npm.

## 6: [Node.js API](nodejs-api.md)

If you're interested in writing a tool that uses {product-name}, then you can use the Node.js API to get programmatic access to functionality.

## 7: [Contributing](contributing/)

Once you've made changes that you want to share with the community, the next step is to submit those changes back via a pull request.
