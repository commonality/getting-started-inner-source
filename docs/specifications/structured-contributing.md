### Improve documentation

As a user of this project you’re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.
Anything!

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, aren’t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
Help make them easier to resolve.

### Give issue feedback

We’re always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker.

### Write or refactor source code

Code contributions are very welcome. It’s often good to first create an issue
to report a bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request to
prevent you from doing unnecessary work.

## Issues

* The issue tracker is for issues. Use chat for support
* Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
  issue
* Ensure you’re using the latest version of projects

### Defect reports

* Use a clear and descriptive title
* Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
  error message, version, operating system, etcetera
* The more time you put into an issue, the more we will
* The best issue report is a [failing test][unit-test] proving it

### Feature and enhancement requests

Is something missing that you believe might add value to the community? Request it!

### Refactoring suggestions

Improve the design of this product.

## Pull requests

* Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
  you from doing unnecessary work
* For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
  community for feedback as soon as possible
* New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
* Don’t include unrelated changes
* Lint and test before submitting code by running `$ npm test`
* Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
  it’s your job to convince us
