## Background

Describe your product in broad terms, generally in just a few paragraphs. Briefly cover motivations, if applicable.

## Installation

- Link to prerequisite sites for programming language: npmjs, godocs, etc.
- Include any system-specific information needed for installation.
- If there is no code in the module - for instance, a document-based module - this section is not required.

```bash
# Provide a code block illustrating how to install

```

## Configuration

Provide configuration options such as required and optional environment variables here. Otherwise, the "Configuration" section is not required.

## Usage

- Add code blocks illustrating common usage.
- If CLI compatible, add code blocks indicating common usage.
- If importable, add a code block indicating both import functionality and usage.
- If possible, link to a working RunKit or Repl.it example of each code block.

## API

Describe public functions or objects in alphabetical order.

- Include signatures, return types, callbacks, and events.
- Declare types if they are not obvious.
- Describe caveats.
- If using an external API generator (like go-doc, js-doc, or so on), point to an external API.md file. This can be the only item in the section, if present.
