# Code of Conduct

> An effective code of conduct isn't just a policy with rules: it's the declaration of values that, when followed,
> should promote productive communities.

## 1. Anatomy of an effective code of conduct

### 1.1. Minimal criteria

At a minimum, a code of conduct must contain:

1. Statement of unacceptable behavior

1. How unacceptable behavior will be addressed

1. How and whom to make an incident report

### 1.2. Ideal behaviors and training

Depending on context, e.g., an open source project versus a public event, codes of conduct might also include:

1. Examples of _expected_ social behavior

1. Training resources for leaders, volunteers, and people who have violated the code of conduct

### 1.3. Professional responsibilities

Some organizations, like the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct), extend their ethical and cultural expectations to encourage professional and academic rigor.

## 2. Popular codes of conduct

Open source projects increasingly adopt either

* [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct][1], or
* [Citizen Code of Conduct][2]

### 2.1. Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

As the name suggests, this document establishes a behaviorial _covenant_ for InnerSource (and open source) collaborators.
